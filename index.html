  hello!sowcoders.<br>
<h1>problem</h1>
There has been about 4million women living in my community who are in need of diapers.It has been a problem since the company was shut down due to inavailability of raw materials to make the diapers.<br>
Due to that i have been able to search for the materials and been able to make nappies from bamboo trees from coast regions.I have made several diapers and people have been buying them at cheaper prices.<br>
</p>
<h2>challenges</h2>
There has been challenge on how to transport the materials <br> from the source to the company but i have consulted to many enployers and i have manage to buy vehicles to transport them.<br>
The vehicles will be taking the nappies in every corner of the country.<br>

  <h3>solution to the problem</h3>
  The solution will be to produce the product and sell them to the people who need them and also to sell in wholesalers,retailers and supermarkets.They will be receiving them every after 2 days to avoid collions.<br>
  We always make 3000 diapers per day and we are able to distribute them faster as possible by use of tuktuk and motor vehicles.<br>
</p>
<h4>charges</h4>
  Due to our customers we will be charging 1 diaper@30ksh and out of this  i will be able to make profit of 10ksh and at the end i will have much money and i can expand in my project.<br>
I will also been able to buy land to start other business projects like building wholesalers and retailers.<br>
